## Mixins
The pattern chosen to minimize the inconsistency between components within the project should keep the components separated by context / style files. Thus, the developers responsible for the project integration will use only one place to get the component. However, if there is the need to create a new component, they must create an issue, indicating the problem and talk to someone from the front-end area.

### Important
If you need to change a mixin, you must change the other that is in the same file, not to generate inconsistency between components.
